# Stock-tracker

Stock-tracker is a simple app that allows users to "buy" stocks and track their portfolio value.

The app allows users to:

1) Create accounts and sign in. New accounts start with $5000 "cash"
2) Search for stocks and purchase shares (if they have enough cash)
3) Check their portfolio's value using current stock prices
4) View the daily trend (increasing, decreasing, or same price) of the stocks in their portfolio
5) Audit past transactions
